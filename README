This is the R code and results files used to generate figures found in Harbert and Nixon, 2018. 
The results come from an analysis of packrat midden plant macrofossils 
using CRACLE to estimate climate from plant coexistence data. This code
is provided as a supplement to illustrate how the paper figures were made.

Anyone who finds their way to this page is encouraged to contact rharbert@stonehill.edu
for more details or with any questions that they may have about this code or the project.
